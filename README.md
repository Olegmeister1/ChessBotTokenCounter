# ChessBot Token Counter

* A small WPF application created for fun during the [chess coding challenge](https://github.com/SebLague/Chess-Challenge/) created by Sebastian Lague
* Feel free to use any part of the code for your own programs
* Alternatively you can clone this repository and use it directly (note that it wasnt tested extensively)
* It quickly shows changes in the token counter of MyBot.cs or any C# file you like

## Intended workflow
* Disable automatic saving in your IDE
* Enter the filepath of your MyBot.cs file
* Everytime you like to measure the current tokens press CTRL + s
